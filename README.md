# css-button-library-upgrade

### This repo is a DRY version of a previous Button Library I put together.

### Though there is no visual change in the rendered display, here,

### custom properties and the calc() function are utilized to make the css code

### much cleaner and easier to modify elements without the need to locate

### and change each one individually, which is tedious and error prone.

### Also, though a bit more complex, it is very easy to create any new button

### with a few variables or simply change a characteristic like the

### background color.
